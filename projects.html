                A world under threat. Massive technology and wealth desparity. A powerful religious body under attack. A world wide sport with a rabid fanbase, and seedy underbelly. </p>

            <p>
                If you had told 20 year old me that I would ever get into graphic design that person would have laughed at you. I still don't consider myself in any way to be an artist, but in order to build Inrenga the way we want it built, I need to know how to make the assets. That means GIMP, Inkscape, and blender. These are on the list after I get comfortable with web development.

        <div class = 'section-box' >
            <h3 class = "section-heading">Future design business</h3>
            <p>I am truly enjoying learning web development and design, and though I have a long way to go I would like to work in the field. I may look into starting a side hustle doing some free lance work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = 'section-box' >
            <h3 class = "section-heading">Merch!!</h3>
            <p>What fun is doing all this design work if I can't put on something? A lot of the work for Inrenga lends itself to merchandise, particularly the sports. It would be supremely cool to see one of my logos out in the wild!!</p>
